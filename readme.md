oidc-jwt-validator is a highly efficient and easy-to-use library for validating JWT tokens. It's built with Rust, providing excellent performance and strong type safety. The library is designed to work with OpenID Connect (OIDC) and handles fetching and caching of JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) from an OIDC issuer.


## Features
- JWT validation against JSON Web Key Sets
- Automatic JWKS fetching from an OIDC issuer
- Intelligent caching of JWKS
- Support for cache-control directives for efficient JWKS management
- Strong type safety with Rust
- Fully asynchronous using Rust's async/await syntax
- Designed for use in high load environments
- Customizable token validation settings
